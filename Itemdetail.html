        <p style="color:white">Biryani is a mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. It is made with Indian spices, rice, and a meat form (chicken, beef, goat, lamb, prawn, fish or eggs). Vegetarian versions of the dish replace meat with vegetables such as potatoes. Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia, as well as among the diaspora from the region. It is also prepared in other states.</p>
